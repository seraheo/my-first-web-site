        <h2>VIRGINIA</h2>
        <p>Virginia, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia, 
        is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions 
        of the United States, between the Atlantic Coast and
        the Appalachian Mountains. The geography and climate of 
        the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains 
        and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of 
        its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; 
        Virginia Beach is the most-populous city, and Fairfax County is 
        the most-populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's population 
        in 2020 was over 8.65 million, with 36% of them living in 
        the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area.
